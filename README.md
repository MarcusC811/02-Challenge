# Horiseon Social Solution

## Horiseon Social Solution website refactor

Hello Horiseon family! I updated some of the source code of the web page to help with accessibility traits it was lacking by adding some semantic HTML elements and alternate text for images displayed on the webpage. Also I consolidated some CSS to help with future editing processes. 

## Helpful Tips

Here we see some before and after pictures of the CSS to help give you an idea of what was done and how it is streamlined now for easy editing

Before:

As you can see, I also added some notes to help break down what else section of CSS is controlling 

## Thank you !!!
